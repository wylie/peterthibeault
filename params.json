The rest of the links will show up only if you have added items to it via the Admin interface.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen you first get to the site you will see a welcome screen. You can't do anything from this page other than be greeted. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n![landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/welcome-section.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Works Section\r\n\r\nThe **Works** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Studio Section\r\n\r\nThe **Studio** section is up and running. _More documentation to come soon_.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## News Section\r\n\r\nThe **News** section is split into two sub-sections: New News & Old News.\r\n\r\n### Old News \r\n![Old News](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/news-old.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the Old News sub-section. You have all your Old News stories listed starting with the newest (also with a green border) at the top, and the oldest story is at the bottom.\r\n\r\nEach Old News story has a delete button so you can, you've guessed it, delete that news story. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## CV Section\r\n\r\nThe **CV** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
