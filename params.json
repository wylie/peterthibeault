The rest of the links will show up only if you have added items to it via the **Admin Interface**.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"sections\"></a>\r\n### Sections\r\n\r\nTo the right of the **Navigation** are the **Sections**, which should look something like this:\r\n\r\n![Homepage: Sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/homepage-section.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have a link to a Section in the **Navigation** then you will see a **Section** of the same name. Simple.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"admin\"></a>\r\n## Admin\r\n\r\nWhen you first get to the **Admin Interface** you will see a welcome screen. You can't do anything from this page other than be greeted. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Admin: Welcome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/welcome-section.png)\r\n\r\nYour only option from here is to click on one of the links at the top.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"works\"></a>\r\n### Works Section\r\n\r\nThe **Works** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time. *Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n<a name=\"oldworks\"></a>\r\n#### Old Works\r\n\r\n*Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n<a name=\"newworks\"></a>\r\n#### New Works\r\n\r\n*Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"studio\"></a>\r\n### Studio Section\r\n\r\nThe **Studio** section is up and running and is split into two sub-sections: **New Studio** & **Old Studio**.\r\n\r\nThe **New Studio** sub-section is where you can add new images of your studio. These images will be uploaded, renamed and tagged with the date you uploaded them. As soon as you upload one of these the **Homepage** gets updated with the new image and date overlay.\r\n\r\nThe **Old Studio** sub-section is where you have the ability to manage old images, and by manage I mean delete. You can delete old **Studio** images\r\n\r\n<a name=\"oldstudio\"></a>\r\n#### Old Studio\r\n\r\nIn the **Old Studio** sub-section you can see all the previous **Studio** images uploaded. You can also manage them.\r\n\r\n![Studio: Old](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/studio-old.png)\r\n\r\nIf you uploaded an image by accident, or decide you don't like an image from years ago you can easily delete that image. All you need to do is click on the red Delete button under the old image. *Note, this action can not be undone!* After you click the Delete button the page will remove the image and you will see all the remaining **Studio** images.\r\n\r\n![Studio: Old - Delete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/studio-old-delete.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"newstudio\"></a>\r\n#### New Studio\r\n\r\nThe **New Studio** sub-section is pretty simple. Here is what it should look like:\r\n\r\n![Studio: New](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/studio-new.png)\r\n\r\nYou have a Stats section showing you how many **Studio** images total you have added.\r\n\r\nBelow that you have a simple form for uploading a new **Studio** image. You will see that the Save button is greyed out and you are unable to click it. This is to prevent you from accidentally uploading clicking it and uploading no image. After you add an image the Save button will activate and turn green. Once you click the Save button you will see a green progress bar. This shows you that the progress of you uploading image. Once the new Studio image has been uploaded and the data has been saved you will see the new Studio image appear at the top left of the old **Studio** images below.  \r\n\r\n**Actions**\r\n- Click on the `Choose File` button to select the new Studio image\r\n- Click the, now green, Save button\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"news\"></a>\r\n### News Section\r\n\r\nThe **News** section is up and running and is split into two sub-sections: **New News** & **Old News**.\r\n\r\nThe **New News** sub-section is where you can add new news.

You can also manage them. You have all your Old News stories listed starting with the newest (also with a green border) at the top, and the oldest story is at the bottom.\r\n\r\n![News: Old](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/news-old.png)\r\n\r\nIf you saved a story by accident, or decide you don't like a story from years ago you can easily delete it.
