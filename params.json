The rest of the links will show up only if you have added items to it via the **Admin Interface**.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"sections\"></a>\r\n### Sections\r\n\r\nTo the right of the **Navigation** are the **Sections**, which should look something like this:\r\n\r\n![Homepage: Sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/homepage-section.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have a link to a Section in the **Navigation** then you will see a **Section** of the same name. Simple.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"admin\"></a>\r\n## Admin\r\n\r\nWhen you first get to the **Admin Interface** you will see a welcome screen. You can't do anything from this page other than be greeted. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Admin: Welcome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/welcome-section.png)\r\n\r\nYour only option from here is to click on one of the links at the top.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"works\"></a>\r\n### Works Section\r\n\r\nThe **Works** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time. *Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n<a name=\"oldworks\"></a>\r\n#### Old Works\r\n\r\n*Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n<a name=\"newworks\"></a>\r\n#### New Works\r\n\r\n*Documentation to come soon.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a name=\"studio\"></a>\r\n### Studio Section\r\n\r\nThe **Studio** section is up and running! It is split into two sub-sections: **New Studio** & **Old Studio**.\r\n\r\nThe **New Studio** sub-section is where you can add new images of your studio.

As soon as you upload one of these the **Homepage** gets updated with the new image and date overlay.\r\n\r\nThe **Old Studio** sub-section is where you have the ability to manage old images, and by manage I mean delete. You can delete old **Studio** images\r\n\r\n<a name=\"oldstudio\"></a>\r\n#### Old Studio\r\n\r\nIn the **Old Studio** sub-section you can see all the previous **Studio** images uploaded.
