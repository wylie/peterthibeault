{"name":"documentation for peterthibeault.com","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome\r\n\r\nThis documentation for [peterthibeault.com](http://peterthibeault.com) will teach you how to use your new website.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Homepage\r\n\r\nThe Homepage is the main page that users see and everything in the Admin section will show up here.\r\n\r\n### Navigation\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the Homepage we have the Navigation, which should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Homepage Navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/homepage-nav.png)\r\n\r\nClicking on one of these links will scroll the page to the top of that Section.\r\n\r\nThe Contact and CV links are the only ones that will always be on the Navigation. The rest of the links will show up only if you have added items to it via the Admin interface.\r\n\r\n### Sections\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Navigation are the Sections, which should look something like this:\r\n\r\n![Homepage Sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/homepage-section.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have a link to a Section in the Navigation then you will see a Section of the same name. Simple.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen you first get to the Admin interface you will see a welcome screen. You can't do anything from this page other than be greeted. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n![landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/welcome-section.png)\r\n\r\nYour only option from here is to click on one of the links at the top.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Works Section\r\n\r\nThe **Works** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Studio Section\r\n\r\nThe **Studio** section is up and running. _More documentation to come soon_.\r\n\r\n### Old Studio\r\n\r\n![Old Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/studio-old.png)\r\n\r\n### New Studio\r\n\r\nThe new Studio sub-section is pretty simple. Here is what it should look like:\r\n\r\n![New Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/studio-new.png)\r\n\r\nYou have a Stats section showing you how many Studio shots total you have added.\r\n\r\nBelow that you have a simple form for uploading a new Studio shot. You will see that the Save button is greyed out and you are unable to click it. This is to prevent you from accidentally uploading clicking it and uploading no image. After you add an image the Save button will activate and turn green. Once you click the Save button you will see a green progress bar. This shows you that the progress of you uploading image. Once the new Studio shot has been uploaded and the data has been saved you will see the new Studio shot appear at the top left of the old Studio shots below.  \r\n\r\n**Actions**\r\n- Click on the `Choose File` button to select the new Studio image\r\n- Click the, now green, Save button\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## News Section\r\n\r\nThe **News** section is split into two sub-sections: New News & Old News.\r\n\r\n### Old News \r\n![Old News](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wylie/peterthibeault/gh-pages/images/news-old.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the Old News sub-section. You have all your Old News stories listed starting with the newest (also with a green border) at the top, and the oldest story is at the bottom.\r\n\r\nEach Old News story has a delete button so you can, you've guessed it, delete that news story. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## CV Section\r\n\r\nThe **CV** section is still being worked on, so nothing can be uploaded or edited at this time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
